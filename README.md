# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz

This week‚Äôs homework is where we build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. It will have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface. 

## User Story

```
AS A coding boot camp student I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz:
‚úì WHEN I click the start button THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
‚úì WHEN I answer a question THEN I am presented with another question
‚úì WHEN I answer a question incorrectly THEN time is subtracted from the clock
‚úì WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0 THEN the game is over
